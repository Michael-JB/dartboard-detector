# Dartboard Detector
Summative coursework by @Michael-JB and @SSutherlandDeeBristol

This project implements Hough transforms from scratch for both line and circle extraction, then combines viola jones data to create a weighted dartboard detector. The implementation is summarised in `report.pdf`.

## Sample Detections

These are some examples of the final detector output given the inputs from `images/`. All detections are shown in `output/detections/`, with intermediate outputs saved in `output/intermediate/`.
